 #Introductory HTML and JavaScript :

         (p2-p39)
    how HTML is used to create web pages ?

how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages ?

HTML elements "made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag" :
<html>
 <body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
 </body>
</html> ,
Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
Attributes: name+value "provide additional information
about the contents of an element" .
